# BreastCancer
The most dangerous kind of cancer, responsible for one-third of all mortality in women,
is breast cancer. Due to the delayed identification, there are high death rate among women worldwide.
Numerous academics have created algorithms using machine learning for the early detection of cancer, but
the methods are time-consuming and the outcomes are uneven because the death rates have not yet dropped.
We developed a procedure and solidified our idea with the aid of an efficient methodology. To improve the
performance of the stacking algorithm and the effectiveness of all strategies, we also provided details about
the data set we selected for our investigation in this report. In this research, using the Fine Needle Aspiration
Technique in conjunction with well-known boosting and bagging algorithms, we have developed a stacking
algorithm using cytopathological data from past investigations conducted by a number of scientists.
